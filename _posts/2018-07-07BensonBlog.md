title: Week 1 @ Metis Data Science Bootcamp: Project Benson!
---

Monday 7/2/18 marked the start the journey into Data Science with Metis.  We are a cohort of 14 people, of varying industry experience and backgrounds.  As we learned primarily about Pandas 
in Week 1, our newfound knowledge was put to the test via **Project Benson!**

The objective of Project Benson was to assist a NYC based non-profit to market and get donors and attendees for their *"Women in Technology"* gala event.  Given the resource constraints of 
the non-profit, the goal of the project was to recoomend those MTA stations where a team could maximize their time to market the event and recruit donors and attendees.
