title: Week 1 @ Metis Data Science Bootcamp: Project Benson!
---

Monday 7/2/18 marked the start of the journey into Data Science with Metis.  We are a cohort of 14 people, of varying industry experience and backgrounds.  As we learned primarily about 
Pandas in Week 1, our newfound knowledge was put to the test via **Project Benson!**

#PROJECT BENSON - OBJECTIVES#
The objective of Project Benson was to assist a NYC based non-profit to market and get donors and attendees for their *"Women in Technology"* gala event.  Given the resource constraints of 
the non-profit, the goal of the project was to recoomend those MTA stations where a team could maximize their time to market the event and recruit donors and attendees.

#PROJECT BENSON - DATA#
For this project the team primarily used [MTA ridership data.](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html).  We analyzed entry data from May and June of 2018, since the gala would be 
held in June 2019.

To provide additional context the team overlaid the following information on the MTA ridership data to target those stations with exposure to women interested or working in technical 
fields:
1. Demographic data of the station localities to filter out stations with large femal populations in their locality
2. Proximity of technology focused companies to the stations
3. Proximity of universities to the stations
4. Demographic data showing the level of education of the population near the stations
